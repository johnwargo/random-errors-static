While testing an Ionic Electron app the other day, I opened a terminal window, navigated to the Ionic project folder, then executed the following command:

```shell
npx cap open electron
```

`npm` whirled and chunked for a little while, then displayed the following error:

```text
[error] Error: Command failed: npm run electron:start
'electron' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE

npm ERR! This is probably not a problem with npm. There is likely additional logging output above.

}
```

This error surprised me, because I assumed the Electron project was configured correctly, but apparently not. I fixed this by executing the following commands In the terminal window:

```shell
cd electron
npm install
cd ..
npx cap open electron
```

The Electron app opened as expected. I'm not sure how the project got into this state, but fortunately it's a quick and easy fix.
