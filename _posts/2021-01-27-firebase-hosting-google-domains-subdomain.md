I'm working a lot lately in Firebase, and when trying to setup Firebase Hosting for one of my domains - I wrote about other issues in https://randomerrors.dev/2021/01/27/firebase-hosting-google-domains. In this case, I want to setup a subdomain (for example: subname.mysite.com), Firebase showed me the following dialog:

![Firebase Hosting Dialog]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/firebase-custom-domain.png)

Put in the first address, click the highlighted + button to open a panel that allows you to add the second address. Easier than expected, but hard for me to notice that button.
