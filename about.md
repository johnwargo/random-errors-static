I'm [John M. Wargo](https://johnwargo.com). 

Over the years, I've learned a lot of different technologies, and even written [a few books](https://johnwargobooks.com) about them. When learning something new, developing an app, building an app server, or writing some useful utility, I regularly encounter weird problems that I never seem to find the resolution to online. 

After encountering a couple of weird ones in a week, I decided to create this site as a place to publish the answers online in the hope I'll help others in need when they need it. I hope this helps you.
